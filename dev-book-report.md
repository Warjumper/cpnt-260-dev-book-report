**Questions;**
**1. Why does this video/article interest you?**

An exploration into basic html will help me build the website(s) of my dreams, and help facilitate a career change that I have been seeking. 

According to the resource listed, more than 74% of all known websites are structured using HTML, and to me, that number looks like job security!

**2. Given the date of publication, is it still relevant?**

Though I could not find an exact first date listed for the specific article, I can see that the website has been operating since 2013. Since then, it has received numerous updates and a browse through the other resources available shows the same system applies to many of the articles listed on the website.

**3. How do you know the author is credible?**

The author has an extensive resume, including such points as;
* 11 years of hands-on experience as a professional Cloud engineer, including substantial experience as a DevOps, Network Administrator, and Technical Support Engineer.
* skilled in AWS and Google cloud;
* certified network engineer;
